## 📁 1. Uploading Files in FastAPI

FastAPI provides **two ways** to handle file uploads:

---

### ✅ **Option 1: Using `bytes`**

```python
from fastapi import File

@app.post("/upload-bytes/")
def upload_bytes(file: bytes = File(...)):
    content = file.decode('utf-8')  # Decode bytes to string
    lines = content.split('\n')     # Split lines
    return {"lines": lines}
```

### 🔍 Behavior:

* 🧠 **Stored in memory**
* Great for small files (e.g., config files, CSVs)
* `file` is a `bytes` object — not a file

### ⚠️ Not suitable for:

* Large files (memory will overload)

---

### ✅ **Option 2: Using `UploadFile`**

```python
from fastapi import UploadFile, File

@app.post("/upload-file/")
async def upload_file(upload_file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    content = await upload_file.read()  # 👈 Read file content
    lines = content.decode('utf-8').split('\n')
    return {"filename": upload_file.filename, "lines": lines}
```

### 🔍 Benefits of `UploadFile`:

* ✅ Stored in memory up to a threshold (then on disk)
* ✅ `.read()`, `.write()`, `.seek()` methods (like a real file object)
* ✅ Access to:

  * `.filename`
  * `.content_type`

---

### 🎯 When to use which?

| Use Case           | Use `bytes`   | Use `UploadFile`   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Tiny config files  | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes              |
| Large media files  | ❌ No (memory) | ✅ Recommended      |
| Need file metadata | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes (`filename`) |

---

## 📥 2. Save Uploaded File to Disk

```python
@app.post("/save-file/")
async def save_file(upload_file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    os.makedirs("uploaded", exist_ok=True)
    file_path = f"uploaded/{upload_file.filename}"
    with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
        content = await upload_file.read()
        f.write(content)
    return {"msg": f"Saved {upload_file.filename} successfully"}
```

* Saves the uploaded file to the `uploaded/` directory.
* Handles directory creation if it doesn't exist.

---

## 🔒 3. Download File (Auth Protected)

```python
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse
from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException
from auth.oauth import get_current_user
import os

@app.get("/download/{file_name}")
def download_file_protected(file_name: str, current_user: dict = Depends(get_current_user)):
    file_path = f"uploaded/{file_name}"
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        return FileResponse(path=file_path, filename=file_name, media_type='application/octet-stream')
    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="File not found")
```

* Only authenticated users (with valid OAuth2 token) can download files.
* Returns 404 if file does not exist.

---

## 🌐 4. Serve Static Files

```python
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles

app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
```

* Any file in the `static/` directory is available at `/static/<filename>`.
* Example: `http://localhost:8000/static/logo.png`

## 🔄 5. Flow Diagrams

### 📤 Upload Flow
```
Client → POST /upload-file/ or /upload-bytes/ → [FastAPI] → (process file) → Response
```

### 💾 Save to Disk Flow
```
Client → POST /save-file/ → [FastAPI] → Save file to /uploaded/ → Response
```

### 🔒 Download Flow (Protected)
```
Client (with Bearer token) → GET /download/{file_name} → [FastAPI]
    ├─ Check token (OAuth2)
    ├─ Check file exists
    └─ Return file (or 404)
```

### 🌐 Static File Flow
```
Browser → GET /static/<filename> → [FastAPI] → Serve file from /static/
```

## 🧪 Testing in Swagger UI

1. **Upload a file**: Use `/upload-file/` or `/upload-bytes/` (choose a small text file for demo).
2. **Save a file**: Use `/save-file/` to persist a file to disk.
3. **Get a token**: Use `/user/token` to log in and get an access token (see OAuth2 docs).
4. **Authorize**: Click **Authorize** in Swagger UI, paste your access token.
5. **Download a file**: Use `/download/{file_name}` (must be logged in).
6. **Access static files**: Place a file in `static/` and access via `/static/<filename>`.

| Feature                 | Method           | Notes                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Upload (small)          | `bytes`          | Fast, lightweight, no metadata         |
| Upload (large/flexible) | `UploadFile`     | File-like object, handles large files  |
| Read file content       | `.read()`        | Asynchronous in UploadFile             |
| Download file           | `FileResponse()` | Use for secure file access / downloads |
| Download (protected)    | `Depends(get_current_user)` | Only for logged-in users   |
| Serve static files      | `StaticFiles`    | Mount static folder                    |

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

* 📂 Upload profile pictures
* 📄 Download PDFs (resumes, receipts)
* 📺 Stream or serve media content
* 🧪 Read CSVs, logs for data processing
* 🛡️ Add auth to downloads (e.g., only logged-in users)

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Always validate file types and sizes before saving.
- Store uploaded files outside the static directory if they should not be public.
- Use authentication for sensitive downloads.
- Clean up unused files to save disk space.
- Use HTTPS in production to protect file uploads/downloads.
